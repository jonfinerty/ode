# Ode

```
It shows you metre, helps you rhyme.
It lets you poem at your prime.
It's not a substitute for craft;
it's here to aid you with your draft.

The dots above, show you the beat,
like rhythm on a music sheet.
Those filled in, signal the stresses,
although these are at best just guesses.

Along the side, a number lays
a count of syllables to gaze.
A measurement of which is great
for keeping lines a certain weight.

Now rest your mouse upon a word
To see the rhymes which are preferred. 
To shortcut through this interface:
You simply press down 'ctrl'+'space'.

One more thing which is quite vital- 
Give your handiwork a title!
So edit "Ode" right at the top,
with something snazzy, make it pop!

Once you're finished with a fanfare, 
look to the bottom and click share-
Add an image to your clipboard;
you can post it and be adored.

I do not claim this tool's correct,
It's likely wrong in some respect.
I'd gladly hear you on the matter
tweet at me and have a chatter.

So here we are, what's left to say?
More features might be on their way!
This site and rhyme was made by Jon;
developer, aged thirty-one.
