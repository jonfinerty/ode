It shows you metre, helps you rhyme.
It lets you poem at your prime.
Its not a substitute for craft,
just here to aid you with your draft.

I do not claim it is correct,
It's likely wrong in some respect.
I'd gladly hear you on the matter

the dots show you the beat
emphasis
introduce ode

So here we are, whats left to say?
More features might be on their way!
