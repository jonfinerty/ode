It shows you metre, helps you rhyme.
It lets you poem at your prime.
It's not a substitute for craft;
it's here to aid you with your draft.

The dots above, show you the beat,
like rhythm on a music sheet.
Those filled in, signal the stresses,
although these are at best just guesses.

Along the side, a number lays
a count of syllables to gaze.
A measurement of which is great
for checking lines to measure weight.

I do not claim it is correct,
It's likely wrong in some respect.
I'd gladly hear you on the matter
tweet at me and have a chatter.

So here we are, what's left to say?
More features might be on their way!
